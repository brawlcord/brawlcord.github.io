While you can host an instance of Brawlcord yourself, please use [the public Brawlcord bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=644118957917208576&scope=bot&permissions=322624&scope=bot) unless you have a good reason to host it yourself.

First make sure you have Red Bot V3 installed. Instructions to install Red Bot can be found [here](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot#installation).

Next add my repo using the following command:

> Note: [p] will be your prefix in all of the following commands.  

`[p]repo add brawlcord https://github.com/snowsee/brawlcord`

Then, you will have to install cog by using the following command:

`[p]cog install brawlcord brawlcord`

You should see the following message after the installation:
> Thank you for installing the Brawlcord cog, based on the mobile game Brawl Stars (developed by Supercell).

Load the cog once you see that message using the following command:
`[p]load brawlcord`

Make sure that you use the `[p]cog update` command to periodically update your cogs. This will ensure that you are getting the latest bug fixes and features. You may also update a specific cog by using `[p]cog update brawlcord`.

**Important Note**: The cog uses external Brawl Stars emotes. They are stored in the following four Discord servers:

- [Brawlcord Community Server](https://discord.gg/7zJ3PbJ)
- [Brawlcord Emotes: SP 1](https://discord.gg/rxZaMmN)
- [Brawlcord Emotes: Ranks](https://discord.gg/5tT88HM)
- [Brawlcord Emotes: Brawlers and Game Modes](https://discord.gg/77Edmna)

Unfortunately, due to Discord limitations, you can't add your bot to these servers directly. In order to have your bot added to the abovementioned servers, you must send me a direct message with your bot's OAuth invite link. While I know this isn't ideal, this is currently the only working way. I'll work on adding an option to disable emotes in the future.
